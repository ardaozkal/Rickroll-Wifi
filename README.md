# Wireless-Rickroll (formerly Rickroll-Wifi)

[![Code Review](http://www.zomis.net/codereview/shield/?qid=131588)](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/q/131588)

A ESP8266 script to rickroll people. Creates an AP with a different name every 5 seconds with strings specified (By default, lyrics of Rick Astley's Never Gonna Give You Up). Not necessarily for rickrolling as you can use it to advertise products or to do a PSA.

It took me 45 minutes to write this ([15 if you leave out me trying to find out how to create an AP](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/30075939#30075939)) Live blog-ish starts [here](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/30075521#30075521) and ends [here](http://chat.stackexchange.com/transcript/message/30076878#30076878).
